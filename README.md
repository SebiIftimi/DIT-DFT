# DIT-FFT

This project demonstrates how to efficiently implement Discrete Fourier Transform algorithm using fundamental harmonic properties and programming techniques.

# One of the most important algorithms of our time

The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an algorithm that is widely regarded as one of the most
significant technological advancements of the 20th century. It is an effective method for 
computing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), which is crucial in converting signals from 
the time domain to the frequency domain.

The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) has a wide range of applications in various fields, including 
data transmission, audio and video signal processing, and medical imaging. It is also essential 
in solving differential equations, spectral analysis, and simulating and optimizing dynamic systems.
