# DIT-DFT

This project demonstrates how to efficiently implement Discrete Fourier Transform algorithm using fundamental harmonic properties and programming techniques.

# One of the most important algorithms of our time

The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an algorithm that is widely regarded as one of the most
significant technological advancements of the 20th century. It is an effective method for 
computing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), which is crucial in converting signals from 
the time domain to the frequency domain.

# What is Decimation in Time (DIT) and why is used in computing DFT?

Decimation in Time (DIT) is a fundamental approach used in the computation of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. It is one of the two main variants of the FFT algorithm, the other being the Decimation in Frequency (DIF).

Under normal circumstances, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) can be calculated using a mathematical formula. <p><i>F(k) = Σ<sub>n=0</sub><sup>N-1</sup> f(n)e<sup>-i2πkn/N</sup></i></p>
This method is effective for computing the DFT for any size of data set. For example, if we consider a data set with 8 values, using the mathematical formula to compute the DFT can be done quickly and accurately. However, if the size of the data set increases to 1,000, 10,000, or 100,000 values, we must consider the efficiency of this method for calculating the DFT. The question then arises, how efficient will this method remain for larger data sets?
